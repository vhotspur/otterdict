OtterDict README
================

OtterDict is a Qt-based application that serves as an interface to
dictionaries available on-line.


Building
--------
To build OtterDict, you need to have (in braces are programs/versions I have 
used when developing)
  * C++ compiler [g++ (GCC) 4.4.0]
  * CMake [2.6]
  * make [GNU Make 3.81]
  * Qt libraries [4.5.2]

I developed OtterDict on GNU/Linux, however it may be possible to port it to 
other systems supported by Qt.

The actual building process is pretty straightforward:
  * unpack the tarball
  * run `cmake' (optionally, create build directory)
  * run `make'
  * run `make install' to install otterdict
Following commands would do the job (if you prefer in-source build, replace
`cmake ..' with `cmake .'):
$ tar -xzf otterdict-0.1.tar.gz
$ cd otterdict-0.1
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
# make install

If you are planning to extend OtterDict, run `doxygen' in root-directory of
OtterDict -- it will create API reference manual in folder gendocs (open the
index.html file in your favourite browser).

Enjoy!
